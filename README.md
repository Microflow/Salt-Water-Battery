Excellent. Ice cube tray design. Screws wrapped with copper wire. Gets 4-5 volts. Shows larger models. Dirt dried out in a couple of days and loses charge. Add 1 or 2 teaspoons of water.

- Made of safe and cheap materials. 
- Peak power limited by low energy density. 
- Non flammable. Pose no risk of explosions.
- Salt water electrolyte.

Drawbacks:

- Peak power limited.
- Efficiency is 90%
- Battery salt water electrolyte limited to 2 volts, must be connected in series to provide useful voltage.

- Battery technology started in 1780s with Galvani and Alessandro Volta. 

** Volta's first experient:** 

Alternating layers of zinc and copper, separated by paper cloth in a salt water solution. 

** Oxidation and Reduction**

- Zinc oxidizes, loses electrons, which are gained by the ions in the water. 

- This process is called reduction, and produces hydrogen gas. 

- Oxidation-Reduction cycle creates a flow of electrons between two substances.  
 
- Hook a vaccuum or light bulb up between the two, you'll give it power. 

- A metal oxidizes, sending electrons to do some work, before they are regained by a substance being reduced.

- A battery has a finite supply of metal. Once most of it has oxidised, the battery dies.

# Cathodes, Anodes, Electrolytes

- Cells are comprised of 3 essential components.

- The Anode is the negative or reducing electrode that releases electrons to the external circuit and oxidizes during and electrochemical reaction.

- The Cathode is the positive or oxidizing electrode that acquires electrons from the external circuit and is reduced during the electrochemical reaction.

The Electrolyte is the medium that provides the ion transport mechanism between the cathode and anode of a cell. Electrolytes are often thought of as liquids, such as water or other solvents, with dissolved salts, acids, or alkalis that are required for ionic conduction. It should however be noted that many batteries including the conventional (AA/AAA/D) batteries contain solid electrolytes that act as ionic conductors at room temperature


## Voltaic Cells

- Current flows out of the cathode. A useful mnemonic for remembering this is CCD: Cathode Current Departs.
- Copper is an anode. An element that gains electrons are used as anode, and those lose electrons used as cathode
- Some metals lose electrons more readily than other metals. 
- This can be exploited to produce a flow of electrons from one piece of metal to another.
- Submerge two pieces of different metals in a conductive solution, such as a solution of metal salts. 
- Zinc and copper can be used to make a voltaic cell because zinc gives up electrons more readily than copper. The metal plates are called the electrodes: the anode and the cathode.

##  Lemon Battery

A battery can be made using a piece of fruit or a vegetable such as a lemon or a potato to provide the electrolyte. 
The juice inside is conductive so when two pieces of metal, such as a copper penny and a zinc nail, are pushed into the fruit, an electric current is produced. This can be used to power a small electronic device with a low power requirement, such as a digital display.
