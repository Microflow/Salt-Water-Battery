# [How Do Batteries Work, TedEd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OVtk6G2TnQ)

- Battery technology started in 1780s with Galvani and Alessandro Volta. 

** Volta's first experient:** 

Alternating layers of zinc and copper, separated by paper cloth in a salt water solution. 

** Oxidation and Reduction**

- Zinc oxidizes, loses electrons, which are gained by the ions in the water. 

- This process is called reduction, and produces hydrogen gas. 

- Oxidation-Reduction cycle creates a flow of electrons between two substances.  
 
- Hook a vaccuum or light bulb up between the two, you'll give it power. 

- A metal oxidizes, sending electrons to do some work, before they are regained by a substance being reduced.

- A battery has a finite supply of metal. Once most of it has oxidised, the battery dies.

# Cathodes, Anodes, Electrolytes

- Cells are comprised of 3 essential components.

OILRIG is an acronym to help remember, Oxidation Is Losing electrons, Reduction Is Gaining electrons.

ANODE - REDUCING - RELEASE ELECTRONS

CATHODE - OXIDIZES - REDUCED/REDUCTIOL - AQUIRES ELECTRONS

- The Anode is the negative or reducing electrode that releases electrons to the external circuit and oxidizes during and electrochemical reaction.

- The Cathode is the positive or oxidizing electrode that acquires electrons from the external circuit and is reduced during the electrochemical reaction.

The Electrolyte is the medium that provides the ion transport mechanism between the cathode and anode of a cell. Electrolytes are often thought of as liquids, such as water or other solvents, with dissolved salts, acids, or alkalis that are required for ionic conduction. It should however be noted that many batteries including the conventional (AA/AAA/D) batteries contain solid electrolytes that act as ionic conductors at room temperature

The species which donates electrons is reductant.

The one which accepts electrons oxidant.

Oxidation: removal of electrons

Reduction: addition of electrons

The one which is undergoing oxidation is called reductant.

The one which is undergoing reduction is called oxidant.

## Voltaic Cells

- Current flows out of the cathode. A useful mnemonic for remembering this is CCD: Cathode Current Departs.
- Copper is an anode. An element that gains electrons are used as anode, and those lose electrons used as cathode
- Some metals lose electrons more readily than other metals. 
- This can be exploited to produce a flow of electrons from one piece of metal to another.
- Submerge two pieces of different metals in a conductive solution, such as a solution of metal salts. 
- Zinc and copper can be used to make a voltaic cell because zinc gives up electrons more readily than copper. The metal plates are called the electrodes: the anode and the cathode.

##  Lemon Battery

A battery can be made using a piece of fruit or a vegetable such as a lemon or a potato to provide the electrolyte. 
The juice inside is conductive so when two pieces of metal, such as a copper penny and a zinc nail, are pushed into the fruit, an electric current is produced. This can be used to power a small electronic device with a low power requirement, such as a digital display.

## What is the best metal to use for electrolysis of water?

** You can use pretty much any metal for the cathode (the electrode that evolves hydrogen), but the anode is more difficult.** 

You need something that will resist corrosion while remaining electrically conductive. The reason this is difficult is because the anode is generating oxygen, and so the anode environment is strongly oxidizing and fiercely corrosive.

If cost is no object, you can use platinum (or probably gold, or other noble metals). These work because the metals are more stable than their oxides, and so they simply won’t corrode under normal conditions.

Lead will work, particularly if you add sodium sulfate salt to the water to make the water more conductive. The lead will form a layer of PbO2, which is one of the few metal oxides that are conductive. Sulfate in the water will keep the lead oxide from dissolving too quickly. But, it does corrode somewhat, and then you have lead in your water.

A compromise is what are referred to as “Dimensionally Stable Anodes”. These are a titanium base, coated with a very thin layer of “mixed metal oxides”, which are proprietary mixtures but I believe they are mostly RuO2 and/or IrO2. These are also electrically-conductive oxides, but unlike PbO2, they are pretty much insoluble in most solutions. I use these in my laboratory, and they last for years. They are fairly pricey (a 1/2 inch diameter rod 4 feet long cost me $140), but if you want a long-lasting, trouble-free anode, they are worth it.
