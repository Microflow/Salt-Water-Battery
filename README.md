## Voltaic Cells

- Current flows out of the cathode. A useful mnemonic for remembering this is CCD: Cathode Current Departs.
- Copper is an anode. An element that gains electrons are used as anode, and those lose electrons used as cathode
- Some metals lose electrons more readily than other metals. 
- This can be exploited to produce a flow of electrons from one piece of metal to another.
- Submerge two pieces of different metals in a conductive solution, such as a solution of metal salts. 
- Zinc and copper can be used to make a voltaic cell because zinc gives up electrons more readily than copper. The metal plates are called the electrodes: the anode and the cathode.

##  Lemon Battery

A battery can be made using a piece of fruit or a vegetable such as a lemon or a potato to provide the electrolyte. 
The juice inside is conductive so when two pieces of metal, such as a copper penny and a zinc nail, are pushed into the fruit, an electric current is produced. This can be used to power a small electronic device with a low power requirement, such as a digital display.
